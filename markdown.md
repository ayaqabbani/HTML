the markdown is an easier way to create a webpage and its considered to be a tool that helps you to style text on web, adding images and creating lists and many other features...

for example you can add an image by typing this command :

 ! [name_your_file] (https://the_image_link.png)

and your image will magically appear infront of you 

and for listing texts you can number it by typing the number followed by a dot and space and the numbering will automatically start when you press enter like :
1. one
2. two
3. three

 or you can list things randomly by starting the text with an asterisks and it will appear with bullet points like this :
 * one
 * two
 * three
 
 and there are alot of states that you can you use and get guided to by the [markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) if you needed help.

## GitHub flavored markdown
the github owns a special version of markdown syntax that offers an additional set of features that makes it easier to ork with markdown on github such as task lists, tables, SHA refrences and many others...
for example you can make a table by typing this command :
Header | Header 2
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

filfill it and it will appear as a table.
