# **growth mindset** ![a brain image](https://cmkt-image-prd.global.ssl.fastly.net/0.1.0/ps/936241/5262/3721/m1/fpnw/wm0/201.brain-knowledge-.jpg?1453777300&s=fc97a1fdf9f570d8f0b2d3f340d78388)
a growth mindset is to believe that most of our basic abilities can be developed either through dedication and working hard to achieve your goal puting the talent and ability as a starting point.
## the differances between a fixed and growth mindset
the fixed is the opposit of the growth mindset, the fixed mindset is surrendering to the myth that you are what are born with either it was talent or mind abilities and believing that you can't achive goals unless you have the talent to do it, while when it comes to growth mindset you only believe in hard work and the failing trying again and raising cycle.
when it comes to dealing with circumstances youre journey ain't going to be rainbows and butterflies so its your choice how to deal with what you face, such as:
1. challenges : the fixed mindset will avoid it while the growth one will embrace it.
2. obstacles : when facing the obstacles the fixed mindset will lose focus but the growth mindset will always find a way to solve it.
3. effort : the fixed mindset will see the effort as a fritless while the growth mindset always adobt the logo of no pain no gain.
4. criticisim : criticisim is important for the growth mindset people because they learn from it otherwise the fixed mindset will ignore it.
5. success of others : the fixed mindset will see successful people as a threat but the growth mindset will get inspired by them.
## my advice 
whenever i get frustrated or feeilng a bit blue i remind my self of my goals and what was the first thing that led me to setting this goal, and when i get confused or some words across my mind like " this is not your place " or " this is to much, you can't do it " i tell my self if they can do it (i mean the people who instruct me) then i can, this word always get me excited and ready for my next move, and whether it was on the professional or the personal stage its not about what you were born with or your surrounding conditions, even if you have a disability, even if you're poor or facing any kind of situations all you have to do is get up, find a new way and never quit trying and never give up on yourself, **be a growth mindset**
